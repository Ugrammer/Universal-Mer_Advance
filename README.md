# Universal-Mer
# Overview
  Universal-Mer is an application for counting k-mers for all possible size of k at once. There is no k limitation. The longest k is equal to the length of the string. However, the longest k for repeated substrings is up on an individual data set which is the length k that include longest repeated substrings.The length k longer than longest repeated substring will show that all k-mers are only unique (occuring once). The Input file can be .txt or fasta format. The input alphabet now is only {A, C, G, T, N} but can be edited later.
