# UNIVERSAL-MER
  This is a command line tool for k-mer counting with all possible sizes of k at once.
# OVERVIEW
<p>Universal-Mer is the k-mer counting tool for all possible size of k at once. More than typical k-mer counting tool, the program can summarize the exact counting result of  1-mers to  l-mers at once where l = the length of longest repeated substring in the input sequence which now is set the maximum length to 100000-mers. In the case k>l, all of them surely occur only once in the input so the number of them  can be computed by L-k+1. The program can  report exactly the number of all repeat (freq>1) and unique(freq = 1) mers , and all possible substrings of the sequence without cutting off any low frequency mers. </p>  
<p>The Input file can be text or fasta format.The input alphabet now is only {A, C, G, T}. The text file input will be concerned as fasta format without description line. After counting and building database of all possible length k of k-mer completed, A user can choose in the menu any size of k to count histogram, dump k-mer, query a substring, and summarize all possible k.</p>
<p>The program count k-mers regardless canonical form. However, the option of canonical form counting is available in the program menu. The canonical k-mer form counting may require a quite more time than the ordinary form. The time and memory for building database depend on the length of input sequence (m) and  the longest repeated substring in the sequence (n), which are in O(mn).  If the memory is insufficient, the program will run slower. In the experiment of very long sequence (200 millions bp from Fragaria Vesca, with CPU apple M1, RAM 16 GB, the program need 30 GB of memory (insufficient memory) and use 2000 - 2500 seconds for building the database. With this database, the program can summarize the number of distinct repeat and unique substrings of 1-mer to 4715-mer(longest repeated substring) within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The program is suitable for the work that want to count several large k of k-mers and to see the overview of the number of distinct repeat and unique for all possible size of k-mers at once.</p>

# REQUIREMENT
  **OS:** Windows10, MacOS_ARM64, MacOS_X64 <br>
  **RAM:** 8-64 GB, depend on the large size of the input sequence, approximately 32 GB for 200 million bp up. <br>
  
# NAME :
  UniversalMer -The k-mer counting tool for all possible size of k at once. 

# SYNOPSIS: 
  UniversalMer [OPTIONS][FILE]

# DESCRIPTION:
        -b FILE : to build new Universal-mer database with an input file (FILE).
        -l  FILE : to load Universal-mer database from FILE. (xxx.Umer) or (xxx.umer) 
        -h : to see how to use the program

  If option is -b  FILE must be a text file or a fasta format file.<br>
  If option is -l  FILE must be a universal-mer database file with the extension '.umer' or '.Umer'. <br>
  If there is no argument, program will search for database file (Universal_merDB.umer) in the same folder with the program.<br>
  After already build or load database, you can follow the instruction of the program to choose menu. <br>

# HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
   Go to the directory of the executable file at  /bin/MacOs/UniversalMer.  <br>
   If there is no database file, run the program to count all possible k-mers first by.
   
       % ./UniversalMer -b  /input/xxx.fasta
      
   The program will build the database of all possible size k-mer.
   After building database completed, you can choose the menu of the program. If the database already exist, you can run the program with it for the next time by
   
       % ./UniversalMer -l  Universal_merDB.umer

  ! Please don't forget to backup the database file for using in the next time. If not, the file will be deleted when you create a new one.
# OUTPUT
  * Universal_merDB.Umer is the default database file generated in the same folder of the executable file.
  * xxxmerHisto.txt is the report of histogram of xxx-mer
  * xxxmerCanonicalHisto.txt is the report of histogram of xxx-mer reducing canonical form.
  * xxx_mersData.txt is the xxx-mers text file with ordinary form.
  * xxx_mersCanodata.txt is the xxx-mers text file reducing canonical form.
  * allKsummarize.txt is the report of the number of distinct repeat and unique 1-mers to l-mers (the length of longest repeated substring).
    
# EXAMPLE
  * The running program pics place in the folder /Output/ <br>
  * The example of database file and input sequence file place in the folder /Example/ <br>
  * The DNA input sequence used in the experiment of our work place in the folder /input/ <br>
